# Dynamic creation element
This 'plugin' allows to create for the moment simply the creation and deletion of input (element) in a form, 
thus allows to create several input as it suits you in the file 'js/creation-item-dynamic.js'.

# Usage

  1. This librairy use Cash (A better and smaller version of Jquery) ```html
    <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/cash/8.1.1/cash.min.js"></script>
    ```
  3. Utilisation of Javascript for better performance (none usage of foreach or function already gave by Js)
Go to the file test.html to have an example of the use. 
For the addition of input, it is enough simply to create new 'Element' that will be added each time when clicking in the form.

An unlimited modification can be done. 
It manages the creation and deletion of input names to be able to have mainly correct names and that are usable for your back-end.

  1. It can only be used on LiveServer
  2. For modification go to ```javascript 
            ./js/creation-dynamic-input.js
            ```
